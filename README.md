# Running the websocket server
Run `npm install` to install dependencies

Run `npm start` to run the server (`index.js`), hosted at localhost:8080

You'll get an "Upgrade Required` message, meaning your client has to request a websocket upgrade.

# Running the websocket interface
Confirm that the server address (wsUri) in `client.html` matches localhost:8080. Then copy the file path, and paste the file path into browser of your choice to run it locally. For me the file path is `/Users/trishapan/Documents/code/websocket-server/client.html`

Et voil√†! Play around with having multiple Chrome profiles open, as well as Chrome Incognito tabs (cmd+shift+N) to send messages!

P.S. You will have to refresh your HTML file/browser ever time you make a change to the client OR the server, because the server automatically resets due to nodemon watching for changes.
